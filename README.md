📘 Project Overview

This repository presents part of the group project “AI for Brain Disease Diagnostics: Strategic Adoption and Market Entry of QP-Brain in UK Healthcare”, conducted at Queen Mary University of London (MSc Business Analytics, 2024/25).

The project explores how Quibim’s QP-Brain, an AI-powered MRI analysis tool for neurological conditions, can be strategically deployed across the NHS England system. It combines market research, data analytics, and strategy design to propose a phased adoption plan for real-world AI implementation in healthcare.

This repository focuses on Section 3: Trust-Level Prioritisation Framework, which forms the analytical foundation of the entire project.

🎯 Section 3 – Trust-Level Prioritisation Framework

The objective of this section is to identify NHS Trusts with the highest potential need for QP-Brain deployment, based on operational capacity, diagnostic burden, and digital readiness.

Analytical Goals

Quantify diagnostic pressure across NHS Trusts.

Integrate multi-source NHS datasets into comparable indicators.

Normalise and score each Trust to measure diagnostic demand.

Apply K-means clustering to segment Trusts into priority groups for phased rollout.

⚙️ Methodology
1. Data Normalisation

Variables scaled using Min–Max normalisation (Go et al., 2020).

Ensures comparability among indicators with different units or directions (↑ good / ↓ good).

x' = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))
​
2. Composite Scoring

Combines multiple indicators (MRI volume, waiting time, radiology staffing, and GDE flag).

Equal weighting applied in the baseline model.

Score_i = (1/n) × Σ(x'_ij) [from j=1 to n]

	​
Higher scores = greater diagnostic burden and stronger AI adoption potential.

3. Trust Segmentation via K-means Clustering

Following Momahhed et al. (2023), K-means clustering was used to group Trusts by operational similarity.
The analysis produced three deployment phases:

Phase	Characteristics	Strategic Implication
Phase 1	High MRI volume + long waiting time	Early deployment & pilot validation
Phase 2	Long waiting + lower volumes	Secondary rollout
Phase 3	Efficient but high workload	Demonstration & scalability sites
📊 Key Insights

Diagnostic workload and workforce gaps are unevenly distributed across NHS Trusts.

A small cluster of large, high-burden Trusts (e.g. UHB, NCA, Imperial College Healthcare) represent optimal pilot sites for early QP-Brain adoption.

The framework enables data-driven, scalable rollout aligned with NHS operational priorities.
